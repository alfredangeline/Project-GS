===============================

o Digilent Inc. has renamed the Nexys4 DDR board to Nexys A7.  We have corrected the documentation that we have control over but we do not have access to the source for many of the MIPSfpga 2.0 documents originally provided by Imagination Technologies. Digilent states that the Nexys4 DDR and the Nexys A7 are identical and only the name has been changed.  They did, however, change the silkscreen so at least one thing changed. 

o Imagination Technologies (the company that produced MIPSfpga 2.0) has been sold and broken up.  Documents, source code, and development tools are now supported by MIPS.com.  At one point Digilent Inc. was supposed to take over support for MIPSfpga, but other than a few YouTube videos I do not see any other evidence of that.  A search for MIPSfpga on the Digilent website (digilentinc.com) returns an empty list.

 o With the transfer of MIPSfpga 2.0 from Imagination Technologies to MIPS.com and (presumably...maybe...who knows for sure) Digilent the exact state of the MIPSfgpa toolchain, particularly C4E is a bit indeterminate.  To the best of our knowledge we are using a stable toolchain and few problems were reported from ECE 540 Fall 2018 so we should be OK.  The tool versions in the documentation, however, are not guarenteed to be correct.   Please report any problems you have to Melih (herdogan@pdx.edu).

o We will be using Vivado 2018.2 this term. We have updated the documents we have control over with this information. 

o This project release was updated for ECE 540 Fall 2018 which also used Vivado 2018.2.  To the best of our knowledge, everything is up to date and works.   Please report any problems you have to Melih  (herdogan@pdx.edu).
